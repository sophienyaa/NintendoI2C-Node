# NintendoI2C-Node

An attempt to build a daemon for a Nintendo Classic Mini controller (and maybe others) for use with RetroPie and similar.

These controllers use the standard I2C protocol to communicate and thus can be read by a Raspberry Pi using its I2C bus.

This project uses work from [Node Virtual Gamepads](https://github.com/miroof/node-virtual-gamepads) by [miroof](https://github.com/miroof)

## Connecting to the Raspberry Pi

Connecting the controller is simple, you can either cut off the plug and wire directly, or use an adapter such as this one from [adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/345)

There are four wires that need to be connected;

* 3.3v - Power Input - Raspberry Pi Pin 1
* Gnd - Power Input - Raspberry Pi Pin 6
* SDA - I2C Data - Raspberry Pi Pin 3
* SCL - I2C Clock - Raspberry Pi Pin 5

The pinout is as per below;

and a pinout for the Raspberry Pi is available at [here](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/i2c)

I found a cheap controller called a "Gioteck Nintendo Mini" These can be had in the UK from from Poundland, Argos, Ebay and similar.

I got mine for Â£5 from Poundland and it is what I am using for testing, as it was so cheap I opted to cut the plug off and add header sockets to plug directy linto the Raspebrry Pi. You can also find them on [ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Gioteck-Turbo-Controller-for-Nintendo-Classic-Mini-From-the-Argos-Shop-on-ebay/362156662685?epid=719581866&hash=item5452381f9d:g:9uUAAOSwXz9Zk3ZV)

## Building and using the daemon

You will need NodeJS installed on your Raspberry Pi before you can use this package, for instructions on how to do that go [here](http://thisdavej.com/beginners-guide-to-installing-node-js-on-a-raspberry-pi/)

You will also need to have the i2c bus enabled and the controller connected, follow the instructions [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c) to do this. The controller should show at address 0x52 and 0x54

Once you've got NodeJS setup and the controller connected and detected, you can follow the below instructions;

1. Clone the source by running;

`$ git clone https://github.com/mickwheelz/NintendoI2C-Node.git`

2. Change to the directory and install the dependancies by running;

`$ cd NintendoI2C-Node/`

`$ npm install`

3. Now you start the daemon by running;

`$ sudo node main.js` or if you want it to run in the background `$ sudo node main.js &`


You can also configure it to run at boot


## How it works

The daemon translates button presses into keyboard presses.

For example;

If you press 'Up' on the controller dpad, the program sends a keyboard 'Up' to the system.

You then map these keys in your application or emulator and you can use the controller as you would normally.

### Default Key Mappings

|Button | Keyboard Key |
|-------|---------------|
Dpad Up | Up Arrow |
Dpad Down | Down Arrow | 
Dpad Left | Left Arrow |
Dpad Right | Right Arrow |
Start |  "1" Key |
Select | "2" Key |
A | "Z" Key |
B | "X" Key |

These mappings can be changed by editing `mapping_keyboard.js`
